## Workflow Documentation Format

For each workflow, create documentation following this format:

### Workflow: [Name]

**Purpose**: Brief description of what this workflow accomplishes

**Prerequisites**: What needs to be set up before this workflow

**Steps**:
1. **Step Name** - `screenshot-filename.png`
   - Description of what happens in this step
   - Key fields/buttons to highlight
   - Expected outcome

2. **Next Step** - `next-screenshot.png`
   - Continue documenting each step

**Result**: What the user achieves by completing this workflow

**Related Workflows**: Links to other workflows that connect

## Key Workflows to Document

### 1. Admin Setup Workflows
- Service Catalog Creation
- Item Catalog Management
- Kit Assembly Process
- Pricing Structure Setup

### 2. Sales Process Workflows
- Property → Opportunity Creation
- Opportunity Stage Progression
- Estimate Building from Services
- Client Presentation and Approval

### 3. Operations Workflows
- Contract Generation from Estimate
- Automatic Work Ticket Creation
- Resource and Crew Assignment
- Schedule Optimization

### 4. Field Execution Workflows
- Work Ticket Start Process
- Time and Material Tracking
- Progress Updates
- Quality Control and Completion

### 5. Financial Workflows
- Cost Variance Analysis
- Profitability Tracking
- Invoice Generation
- Payment Processing

## Screenshot Best Practices

1. **Consistency**: Use same browser, resolution, and zoom level
2. **Annotations**: Add arrows/boxes to highlight key elements
3. **Data**: Use realistic sample data (not production)
4. **Context**: Include enough UI to show navigation context
5. **File Naming**: Use descriptive names with step numbers

## Integration Notes

These workflows demonstrate how Platform-ERM implements the superior Aspire hierarchy:

```
Property → Opportunity → Contract → Work Tickets
```

This provides significant advantages over LMN's single-tier approach:
- Granular cost tracking at service level
- Standardized service catalog
- Automatic work ticket generation
- Multi-level profitability analysis

Add your workflow screenshots to the appropriate subdirectories and update this README as new workflows are documented.
