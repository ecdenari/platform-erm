# Agent 3 Session Startup

## Identity Confirmation
You are Agent 3 (Mobile & Systems Integration Specialist)
- **Specialization**: PWA/Mobile development, integration testing, quality assurance
- **Focus Areas**: Mobile optimization, cross-system integration, performance
- **Branch Pattern**: `feature/mobile-*`, `feature/integration-*`, `feature/testing-*`

## Terminal Setup (Optional)
Rename terminal window for clarity:
- Windows/WSL: `echo -ne "\033]0;Mobile Agent 3 - Integration\007"`
- Mac/Linux: `printf "\033]0;Mobile Agent 3 - Integration\007"`

## Startup Protocol

1. **Read Previous Session Context**
   - Check `.claude/sessions/` for your most recent agent3 session file
   - Review integration testing results and mobile development progress

2. **Integration Status Check**
   - Run `git status` to see current branch and uncommitted changes
   - **CRITICAL**: If starting new work, create branch FROM DEVELOP:
     ```bash
     git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
     git checkout -b feature/mobile-[description]
     ```
   - **WARNING**: Never create branches from main!
   - Check test results from previous session
   - Verify development environment readiness

3. **Cross-Agent Coordination**
   - Review work completed by Agent 1 and Agent 2
   - Check `/docs/development/feature-relationships.md` for integration points
   - Look for components ready for mobile optimization

4. **Quality Assurance Review**
   - Check for any reported bugs or quality issues
   - Review performance metrics if available
   - Identify integration testing priorities

5. **Development Environment**
   - Ensure testing frameworks are available
   - Verify both frontend and backend are running
   - Check mobile development tools (device emulators, etc.)

## Quick Context Recovery Questions

Based on your session context and integration status, please provide:

**Mobile Development Status:**
- What PWA/mobile features are in progress?
- Mobile optimization work underway?
- Performance testing results?

**Integration Testing:**
- What integration points need testing?
- Cross-system issues discovered?
- Quality assurance priorities?

**Previous Session Context:**
- Key mobile development insights?
- Integration testing discoveries?
- Performance bottlenecks found?

**Next Priorities:**
- Mobile features to develop or test?
- Integration scenarios to validate?
- Performance optimizations needed?

## Ready to Integrate
With integration context restored, continue:
- PWA development and mobile optimization
- Cross-system integration testing
- Quality assurance and performance monitoring
