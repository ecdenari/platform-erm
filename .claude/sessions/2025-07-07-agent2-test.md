# Agent 2 Session Context - 2025-07-07

## Current Work Status
- **Active Branch**: develop (should be feature/docs-session-management)
- **Last Commit**: 2bad66a feat: initial repository setup with multi-agent workflow integration
- **Progress Percentage**: 100% on session context system, 100% on assignment switching
- **Primary Files Edited**: 
  - `.claude/commands/end-session.md` (enhanced with context capture)
  - `.claude/commands/switch-agent-assignment.md` (new command)
  - `CLAUDE.md` (added session management sections)
  - All agent role files (added assignment history)
  - `docs/tracking/completion-log.md` (updated with implementations)

## Mental State & Approach
- **Problem Being Solved**: Eliminating "empty terminal memory" problem for seamless session handoffs
- **Strategy/Approach**: Created dual-system approach - session context for daily work + assignment switching for module transitions
- **Key Insights This Session**: 
  - Session context and assignment switching are complementary, not competing systems
  - Assignment transitions are special session context events
  - Terminal renaming is platform-specific but optional
- **Decisions Made**: 
  - Keep session files in `.claude/sessions/` to align with `.claude/commands/`
  - Enhance existing end-session command rather than create new one
  - Add assignment history to all agent role files for complete audit trail

## Technical Context
- **Architectural Decisions**: 
  - Session files use daily format: YYYY-MM-DD-agent[X].md
  - Assignment switches create special transition entries
  - Startup commands guide through context restoration
- **Performance Considerations**: Session files are lightweight markdown, no performance impact
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Works alongside completion-log.md (different purposes)
  - Complements todo system (adds context layer)
  - Enhances agent role files (doesn't replace)
- **Code Patterns Used**: Command-based workflow automation, markdown documentation

## Blockers & Questions
- **Current Blockers**: None - all systems implemented successfully
- **Questions for Other Agents**: None currently
- **External Dependencies**: None
- **Research Needed**: Could explore advanced TodoRead filtering in future

## Next Session Plan
- **Immediate Next Steps**: 
  1. Test the session context system with actual use
  2. Create feature branch for this work (currently on develop)
  3. Commit all changes with proper conventional commit message
  4. Monitor Agent 1's use of new system for Properties development
- **Files to Focus On**: Watch for any issues with commands or templates
- **Expected Outcomes**: Agents should have seamless session transitions

## Cross-Agent Impact
- **Work Affecting Others**: All agents benefit from session context system
- **API Changes Made**: None
- **Shared Component Modifications**: Enhanced all agent role files
- **Coordination Requests**: Agents should start using new commands immediately

## Session Highlights
- **Time Spent**: ~2 hours on complete implementation
- **Major Accomplishments**: 
  - Implemented full session context system
  - Added agent assignment switching capability
  - Integrated both systems seamlessly
  - Updated all documentation
- **Lessons Learned**: 
  - Small enhancements (session context) can solve big problems (empty terminals)
  - Assignment history is valuable for audit trails
  - Command-based workflows reduce manual work significantly
