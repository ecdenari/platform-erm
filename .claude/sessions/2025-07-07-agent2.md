# Agent 2 Session Context - 2025-07-07

## Current Work Status
- **Active Branch**: feature/docs-session-management
- **Last Commit**: 1c095b7 feat(docs): implement enhanced session context system and agent assignment switching
- **Progress Percentage**: 100% on session context system, 100% on assignment switching
- **Primary Files Edited**: 
  - `.claude/commands/` - All session and assignment commands
  - `CLAUDE.md` - Added session management and assignment sections
  - All agent role files - Added assignment history
  - `docs/development/feature-relationships.md` - Created feature dependency tracking
  - `docs/tracking/completion-log.md` - Updated with all implementations

## Mental State & Approach
- **Problem Being Solved**: Eliminated "empty terminal memory" problem with comprehensive session management
- **Strategy/Approach**: Dual-system approach - session context for daily work + assignment switching for module transitions
- **Key Insights This Session**: 
  - Session context and assignment switching are perfectly complementary
  - Testing revealed need for branch verification in startup commands
  - System ready for production despite minor enhancements possible
- **Decisions Made**: 
  - `.claude/sessions/` directory structure aligns with commands
  - Assignment history adds valuable audit trail to agent roles
  - Enhanced existing commands rather than creating competing systems

## Technical Context
- **Architectural Decisions**: 
  - Session files preserve both technical and mental state
  - Assignment transitions are special session events
  - Startup commands guide through complete restoration
- **Performance Considerations**: Lightweight markdown files, no performance impact
- **Integration Points**: 
  - Seamlessly extends existing slash commands
  - Works alongside completion-log.md for different purposes
  - Enhances agent roles without disrupting structure
- **Code Patterns Used**: Command-based workflow automation, consistent markdown templates

## Blockers & Questions
- **Current Blockers**: GitHub push requires manual authentication
- **Questions for Other Agents**: None - system ready for use
- **External Dependencies**: None
- **Research Needed**: Future enhancement - automatic branch verification

## Next Session Plan
- **Immediate Next Steps**: 
  1. Manual push to GitHub when authentication available
  2. Monitor Agent 1's adoption of session commands
  3. Watch for any issues or enhancement requests
  4. Prepare for Purchase Order system work after Properties
- **Files to Focus On**: Monitor command usage and session files
- **Expected Outcomes**: All agents using session system successfully

## Cross-Agent Impact
- **Work Affecting Others**: All agents now have session management capabilities
- **API Changes Made**: None
- **Shared Component Modifications**: Enhanced all agent role files
- **Coordination Requests**: Agents should adopt new commands immediately

## Session Highlights
- **Time Spent**: ~3 hours total implementation and testing
- **Major Accomplishments**: 
  - Complete session context system operational
  - Agent assignment switching integrated
  - Live testing confirmed system effectiveness
  - All documentation updated comprehensively
- **Lessons Learned**: 
  - Live testing essential for finding branch issues
  - Session context successfully preserves mental state
  - Command automation significantly improves workflow
